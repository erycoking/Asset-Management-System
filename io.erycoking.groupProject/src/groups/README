This module adds students into the database, updates their records and deletes their records too.
Then it allows you to generate a random list of students and put them into groups of 4.
It also picks a group leader for you and if satisfied with the list it lets you print the list.

Instructions on how to create the database for students where:
name is a string, registration number a string and the primary key, leader a boolean value either true or false.

 
       create table students (regno varchar(25) primary key not null, name varchar(45) not null, leader tinyint(1));
